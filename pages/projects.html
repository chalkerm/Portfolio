    <h3>Media</h3>
    <p class="text-block">The first two videos are part of my work with US Glove. I hired professional videographers, casted athletes, wrote, directed, and devised a marketing video to promote products, all within budget. The second 2 videos are of a project I created using C++ and an Arduino board in EECS 183, then presented at the annual showcase. My group recreated the popular game, 2048, on the Arduino board. We animated the start and end game displays, and designed the blocks to slide smoothly across the board on command.</p>

        <h3>US Glove Website 1.0</h3>
        <p class="text-block">Below are screenshots of the website before the redesign. This version of the website had significant information architecture issues  - there was no clear user flow and an unclear visual hierarchy. Too many of the tabs led to dead ends or the incorrect page.</p>

        <h3>US Glove Website 2.0</h3>
        <p class="text-block">This is the version of the website that I helped redesign, with the goal of improving user experience and reflecting brand identity. I conducted usability testing to address problems with user flow. Since our website was the intersection between our physical product, the consumers, and our brand, it was important to ensure that it resonated with customers to optimize conversion rate between site visitors and consumers.</p>
